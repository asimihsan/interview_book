-   Linked lists, solve 3 problems, put them into site and book.

-   Strings - rework solutions, focus on solving them using the framework.

-   Integrate Graphviz with build process. Some custom tags should denote
"remove this from text, generate diagram, insert link to image" so that I can
easily draw some images, even if these images are later replaced with higher
quality ones.

-   Integrate PlantUML with build process. Save this for OS / Internet sections.
