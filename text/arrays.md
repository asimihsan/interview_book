### 1. Pair Sums to K (Amazon, Palantir)

Given an unsorted array of integers and an integer `k`, find two integers that
sum to `k`. Integers in the array may be a mixture of negative, zero, and
positive, and are not necessarily unique. If there is more than one possible
pair return any valid pair. Assume that you don't have to handle integer
overflow.

If there are no matching integers return your language's equivalent of null /
None. Moreover when returning the matching integers, return the smaller of the
two as the first integer in the pair.

For example:

-   `[-1, 5, 6, 3], 2` would return `(-1, 3)`

Identify two possible solutions:

1.  A solution in O(n) time that minimizes the space complexity.
2.  A solution in O(1) space that minimizes the time complexity.
