# How to prepare for coding interviews

Interviews are games. Companies structure their interviews to minimize false positives, because it's far more expensive to hire a low quality candidate than to wrongly reject a high quality candidate. Larger companies tend towards phone screens and face-to-face interviews on whiteboards on topics like balanced search trees, string searching, and tries. Smaller companies tend towards having a coffee or a drink to evaluate "cultural fit" and pair programming exercises on small concrete projects. Either way the interview process is a game: completely artificial and with arbitrary rules and obstacles that you wouldn't encounter in a real day-job setting.

Like any other game, the best way to prepare for interviews is to prepare for interviews. All games require focused practice with feedback within the context of that game. You practice, figure out what your weak points are, keep practicing with the weak points in mind, assess yourself again, and continue iterating.

## How to use a practice problem

The worst possible way to solve a practice problem is to code it up in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Xcode, whilst searching on Stack Overflow for hints. You need to recreate the exact environment and mindset of the interview process you expect to encounter. Specifically, take the next problem and randomly do one the following:

-   A third of the time imagine that you're talking through the solution with a colleague on a piece of paper. Imagine, just like in real life, that you must talk through the problem at a high-level first in an understandable way, breaking it down into sub-problems, etc. Write your solution code on a piece of paper. Whatever is on the paper at the end must compile first-time when you type it out into an editor and run it.

-   Another third of the time type out your solution in a featureless editor, like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac OS X, or a website like CollabEdit. Whatever you type out must compile first-time, and if it doesn't figure out why and keep practicing with that in mind.

-   The last third of the time write out your answer on a whiteboard, imagining that you're in an interview and loudly talk to yourself. Everything you write must compile first-time when you type it into an editor. (You don't need a massive physical whiteboard, especially for home. Instead you could buy a [magic whiteboard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magic-Whiteboard-MAGICWHITE/dp/B001P5UAV8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428285789&sr=8-1&keywords=magic+whiteboard) that can be stuck onto your wall).

## Interviews involve people

Interviewers are mostly evaluating your skill at communicating your thought process and your solution to problems. Arriving at the solution is important but secondary to communicating how you arrived at the solution, what other solutions your rejected, and what tradeoffs the solution makes. During an interview you are constantly being evaluated for your potential to succeed in general at the company; your ability to eliminate ambiguity, explain complex ideas to others, and how you behave when you encounter a problem you cannot immediately solve.

The best way to practice this type of communication is often at your day job. Simply offering to give a talk on some complex area you're responsible for, or more directly asking your colleagues or friends to give you mock interviews, will give you the practice and confidence you need for real phone screens and face to face interviews.
